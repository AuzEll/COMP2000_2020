Clone this repository (well done!)

# Task 1

Take a look at the two repositories:

  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

  * These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites?  What service do they provide? Which is better?
  
  Ans: These are sites that assist in versional control for applications of code. Files can be uploaded and stored through a cloud to these sites, and whenever code is changed it can pushed and updated through commits. Both sites provide an acceptable range of tools and functionalities to the user.

  * Who made the last commit to repository A?

  Ans: Matt Roberts

  * Who made the first commit to repository A?

  Ans: Jon Mountjoy

  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B?

  Ans: Dave Pearce

  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? ðŸ¤” If not, what do you think happened?

  Ans: Repo A might be inactive now as the last commit was 2 neary 2 years ago. The last commit was titled 'First round of meddling' which may indicate the code was tampered with in the last commit. Repo B's last commit was only 22 days ago so it could still be active.

  * ðŸ¤” Which file in each project has had the most activity?

  Ans: Both have an estimated run time of around 4 years, although repo B has a lot more commits on record. Repo B most likely has had the most activity.

# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints
